UVa programming solutions written in Java, there are a variety of solutions located within.

Why this is nice is that it enforces ideas of time complexity and implementing algorithms in an actual code, opposed to it just laying in theory.

In the file name is the title of the problem, followed by the UVa number that can identify this particular problem. A quick google search will bring up the problem on the website! Eg; Freckles: https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&page=show_problem&problem=975
